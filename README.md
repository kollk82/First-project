# First-project
-- My first portfolio (literally first) done in the first half on my CCT Web Development Course... since that loooong break.   
-- Fun fact is that 3 months at CCT gave me more experience than one year at DID..  
-- ...or am I more committed...  
-- Long break from writing HTML/CSS  
-- only HTML and CSS here  
-- some flexbox attempts, at this stage just messing with it.  
-- >< >< CSS is bad.  
-- nothing changed since last time Flexbox, Grid...Grid??  
-- I knew Bootstrap by name...pointless, can't learn CSS with this s><t.  
-- VSCode high five.  
--Thats it.
